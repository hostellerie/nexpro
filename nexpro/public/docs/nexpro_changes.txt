    Nexform plugin updates to add the autoinstall and autouninstall scripts.
    Required that all nexform table references be changed so that the $_TABLES['tablename'] match the created table names.
       Some of the $_TABLES key names were a combination of upper and lowercase as well. All lower case now.
       Any custom code that used the previous $_TABLES references to the nexform tables will need to be updated


       New $_TABLES definitions:
       $_TABLES['nxform_definitions']       = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_definitions';
       $_TABLES['nxform_fields']            = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_fields';
       $_TABLES['nxform_results']           = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_results';
       $_TABLES['nxform_resdata']           = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_resdata';
       $_TABLES['nxform_restext']           = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_restext';
       $_TABLES['nxform_results_tmp']       = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_results_tmp';
       $_TABLES['nxform_resdata_tmp']       = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_resdata_tmp';
       $_TABLES['nxform_restext_tmp']       = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_restext_tmp';

       Previous $_TABLES definitions:
       $_TABLES['formDefinitions']       = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_definitions';
       $_TABLES['formFields']            = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_fields';
       $_TABLES['formResults']           = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_results';
       $_TABLES['formResData']           = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_resdata';
       $_TABLES['formResText']           = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_restext';
       $_TABLES['formResultsTmp']        = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_results_tmp';
       $_TABLES['formResDataTmp']        = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_resdata_tmp';
       $_TABLES['formResTextTmp']        = $_DB_table_prefix . 'nxform_restext_tmp';

    Forum Plugin Updates
       - Use new autoinstall feature
       - Use online config feature instead of the built-in forum settings

			1)  Issue with the Active Forum icon would not always
	  			display when there were new posts in a forum.
			2) 	Fixed issue where the index page would incorrectly display Today
	  			as the last post date when in fact that wasn't true.

Oct 8/2009 (Blaine)
    Added a new API to nexflow to allow custom code to change tha task name
    API is called: PLG_Nexflow_taskname();
    Fixed an issue in nexflow.class.php in how it set the taskname. If task is set to have a Dynamic Taskname
          and the code does not return a name, maybe process variable is not set, then use the fixed name.
	  The PLG_Nexflow_taskname is called after that and can replace or append to the name as required.
