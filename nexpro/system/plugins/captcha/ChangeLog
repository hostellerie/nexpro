CAPTCHA ChangeLog

v3.0.2

[fix] Typo in the DB_save call referenced the wrong table.
[new] Plugin now works with MSSQL installs as well as MySQL.

v3.0.1

[fix] Fixed a bug where CAPTCHA did not protect Forum entries under most
      circumstances.
[new] For static images now report if failure to open static image file.

v3.0.0

[new] Supports Geeklog v1.4.1 or newer - removed support for older systems
[new] Removed dependence on PHP Sessions, now use a custom database session
      manager.
[new] Added support for 'Remote Users', this will allow you to require
      CAPTCHA entry for users who login using OpenID credentials.
[new] Added support for limiting the number of image refreshes.  This will
      prevent bots/users from trying to overload your server with CAPTCHA
      image requests
[fix] Fixed an issue where a failed install would not display a status message

v2.1.2

      config.php

      image) without reloading the entire page.

v2.0.2

[fix] PHP4 requires template names to be passed by reference. In my zest to
      remove a warning generated by PHP5 on pass by reference calls, I removed
      too much.
